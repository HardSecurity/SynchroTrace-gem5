# SynchroTrace is the trace replay module that plays back traces generated by
# a tool called Sigil [1]. The traces are per-thread and record not only
# compute operations and memory accesses local to the thread but also inter-
# thread communication and synchronisation primitives like locks and barriers.
# The information in the traces is architecture-agnostic. The traces are then
# replayed by the SynchroTrace model in gem5 to achieve light-weight multicore
# simulation [2].
#
# Sigil, the tool used to generate the traces is not included in gem5 but
# lives in a public repo on github [3] and has user documentation [4].
